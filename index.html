        <h2>Earth</h2>
        (1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi) from the Sun) is the largest and
        densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current
        geological activity, and the only place where life is known to
        exist.[85] Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial
        planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been
        observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the
        other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain
        21% free oxygen.[86] It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only
        large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.

      <section class="mars">
        <h2>Mars</h2>
        (1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun) is smaller than
        Earth and Venus (0.107 MEarth). It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon
        dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg)
        (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth).[87] Its surface, peppered with vast
        volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles
        Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as
        recently as 2 million years ago.[88] Its red colour comes from iron
        oxide (rust) in its soil.[89] Mars has two tiny natural satellites
        (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids,[90] or
        ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history

      <section class="venus">
        <h2>Venus</h2>
        (0.7 AU (100 million km; 65 million mi) from the Sun) is close in size
        to Earth (0.815 MEarth) and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle
        around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal
        geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is
        ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the
        hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most
        likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[83] No
        definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on
        Venus, but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its
        substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being
        replenished by volcanic eruptions.

      <section class="jupiter">
        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        (5.2 AU (780 million km; 480 million mi)), at 318 MEarth, is 2.5 times
        the mass of all the other planets put together. It is composed largely
        of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates
        semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the
        Great Red Spot. Jupiter has 80 known satellites. The four largest,
        Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, are called the Galilean moons: they
        show similarities to the terrestrial planets, such as volcanism and
        internal heating.[108] Ganymede, the largest satellite in the Solar
        System, is larger than Mercury; Callisto is almost as large.
